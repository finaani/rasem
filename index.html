<h1>Draw Machine-ah!</h1>
<p>My Machine is based on moods. I used gradient colors to express one's emotions as it is not easy to do for most people.
  <br>Here I use the graidents on color and how fast or slow it changes that corellates with our emotions.
  This is to show how fast or slow our feelings play with our day to day lives.</p>
play around with my invention and see what you feel. It's a modern day mood ring!
<p> first, draw on screen!
  <br> Then, enter here! <a href="page1.html">Gradient</a>
